Micro System has released lot of rules for JAVA and those rules are implemented by JavaSoft Inc,

- JAVA released to the market in three categories J2SE (JAVA 2 Standard Edition), J2EE (JAVA 2
Enterprise Edition) and J2ME (JAVA 2 Micro/Mobile Edition). <br>
i. J2SE is basically used for developing client side applications/programs. <br>
ii. J2EE is used for developing server side applications/programs. <br>
iii. J2ME is used for developing server side applications/programs. <br>

- If you exchange the data between client and server programs (J2SE and J2EE ), by default JAVA is
having on internal support with a protocol called http. J2ME is used for developing mobile
applications and lower/system level applications. To develop J2ME applications we must use a
protocol called WAP (Wireless Applications Protocol).
