## class
* A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
* class consist of different methods.
* We can create the object of class.
* The main() is the starting point for JVM to start execution of a Java program. Without the main() method, JVM will not execute the program.

## class naming conventions 
### conventions :-
* Convensions is not mandatory but we need to follow this conventions based on industrial standards.
1) The first letter of the class name should be in terms of upper case.<br>
   &nbsp; e.g. Summation <br>
2) We can not give the space between the class name.<br>
   &nbsp; e.g. ProgramOne <br>
3) We can use two special type characters.<br>
   &nbsp; $ and  _ <br>
4) We can not start class name with numeric value. If we want to use numeric value we can provide after defining class name.<br>
   &nbsp; e.g. Program1 <br>
5) We can not use keyword as a class name. It will show compile time error.<br>
   &nbsp; e.g. public, static <br>
