## How java works ?
* In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the **_.java_** extension.
* Those source files are then compiled into **_.class_** files by the javac compiler.
* A **_.class_** file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes.
* This **_.class_** file is capable to run on any machine which have Virtual Machine (Java VM) has installed.

* Because the Java VM is available on many different operating systems, the same **_.class_** files are capable of running on Microsoft Windows, the Solaris™ Operating System (Solaris OS), Linux, or Mac OS.
* Some virtual machines, such as the Java SE HotSpot at a Glance, perform additional steps at runtime to give your application a performance boost.

## What is java development kit ?
* The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.

## What is JRE (Java Run Time Environment) ?
* JRE stands for “Java Runtime Environment” and may also be written as “Java RTE.” The Java Runtime Environment provides the minimum requirements for executing a Java application; it consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core classes, and supporting files.
  
## What is JVM (Java Virtual Machine) ?
* Java Virtual machine(JVM) is a very important part of JRE (Java Run Time Environment). Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line hence it is also known as interpreter.
