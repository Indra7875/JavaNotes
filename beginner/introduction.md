## Programming Language 
* It is the set of instructions to do a perticular task by the machine.
* Programming language is classifed into low level language, high level language and middle level language.
### 1) Low level language 
* The language which is understandable and executable by the machine is called as low level language.
* e.g. binary language
### 2) High level language 
* The language which is readble,writable, understandable and executable by programmer is called as high level language.
* e.g. C++,java,python.
### 3) Middle level language
* It is mixture of low level and high level language.
* e.g. C
* C is called middle-level language because it actually binds the gap between a machine level language and high-level languages. A user can use c language to do System Programming (for writing operating system) as well as Application Programming (for generating menu driven customer billing system ).
